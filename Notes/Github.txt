##I will use github even if it kills me becuase I hate myself
##when creating a git repo, create the repo, clone the repo, then place stuff inside, this works best
##never try and pull, unless positive what it does/overwrites, pull to seperate file to test

##CREATE NEW STEPS
#create a new repo
#go into folder The City Planner's Duel, naviaget to this in terminal
#git clone ---repo address---
#now it creates the desired folder
#now create the godot project inside this folder that has the git repo (turn of create project folder when making it, its a slider)


#right click on the res:// to go into the terminal at right folder
#git status
#git add .
#git commit -m "A initial working build"
#git push origin main
