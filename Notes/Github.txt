##I will use github even if it kills me becuase I hate myself
##when creating a git repo, create the repo, clone the repo, then place stuff inside, this works best
##never try and pull, unless positive what it does/overwrites, pull to seperate file to test

##CREATE NEW STEPS
#create a new repo
#go into folder The City Planner's Duel, naviaget to this in terminal
#git clone ---repo address---
#now it creates the desired folder
#now create the godot project inside this folder that has the git repo (turn of create project folder when making it, its a slider)


#right click on the res:// to go into the terminal at right folder
#git status
#git add .
#git commit -m "A initial working build"
#git push origin main




A Dark Day has passed.
* Problem: I get a safe save error
	Source: I get this when i clone a gibub godot project into a folder that is being saved to onedrive
	Fix: Move the folder into my C drive/Projects (not being saved to onedrive) and then clone into this folder (clone into TheCityPlannersDuelDevelopment)
	
Files:
* Main Software will be in C/Projects/TheCityPlanner'sDuelDevelopment
* the word docs and stuff will be in Desktop/Projects being saved to onedrive.
